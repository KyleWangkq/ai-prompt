# Java 8 Development with Lombok

## General Instructions

- First, prompt the user if they want to integrate static analysis tools (SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle)
  into their project setup. If yes, provide guidance on tool selection and configuration.
- If the user declines static analysis tools or wants to proceed without them, continue with implementing the Best practices, bug patterns and code smell prevention guidelines outlined below.
- Address code smells proactively during development rather than accumulating technical debt.
- Focus on readability, maintainability, and performance when refactoring identified issues.
- Use IDE / Code editor reported warnings and suggestions to catch common patterns early in development.

## Best practices

- **Lombok Annotations**: Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code:
  - `@Data` for DTOs and data classes (generates getters, setters, equals, hashCode, toString)
  - `@Value` for immutable classes (generates getters, equals, hashCode, toString, and makes fields final)
  - `@Builder` for complex object construction
  - `@Slf4j` for logging
  - `@RequiredArgsConstructor` / `@AllArgsConstructor` for constructors
- **Data Classes**: For data-holding classes (DTOs, entities), use `@Data` or `@Value` annotations instead of writing boilerplate code manually.
- **Builder Pattern**: Use `@Builder` for classes with multiple optional parameters to improve readability.
- **Immutability**: Favor immutable objects. Use `@Value` for immutable classes. Make fields `final` where possible. Use `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or Google Guava's `ImmutableList` for fixed data.
- **Streams and Lambdas**: Use the Streams API and lambda expressions for collection processing. Employ method references (e.g., `stream.map(Foo::toBar)`).
- **Null Handling**: Avoid returning or accepting `null`. Use `Optional<T>` for possibly-absent values and `Objects` utility methods like `equals()` and `requireNonNull()`.

### Naming Conventions

- Follow Google's Java style guide:
  - `UpperCamelCase` for class and interface names.
  - `lowerCamelCase` for method and variable names.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - `lowercase` for package names.
- Use nouns for classes (`UserService`) and verbs for methods (`getUserById`).
- Avoid abbreviations and Hungarian notation.

### Bug Patterns

| Rule ID | Description                                                 | Example / Notes                                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `S2095` | Resources should be closed                                  | Use try-with-resources when working with streams, files, sockets, etc.                           |
| `S1698` | Objects should be compared with `.equals()` instead of `==` | Especially important for Strings and boxed primitives.                                           |
| `S1905` | Redundant casts should be removed                           | Clean up unnecessary or unsafe casts.                                                            |
| `S3518` | Conditions should not always evaluate to true or false      | Watch for infinite loops or if-conditions that never change.                                     |
| `S108`  | Unreachable code should be removed                          | Code after `return`, `throw`, etc., must be cleaned up.                                          |

## Code Smells

| Rule ID | Description                                            | Example / Notes                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S107`  | Methods should not have too many parameters            | Refactor into helper classes or use builder pattern.                          |
| `S121`  | Duplicated blocks of code should be removed            | Consolidate logic into shared methods.                                        |
| `S138`  | Methods should not be too long                         | Break complex logic into smaller, testable units.                             |
| `S3776` | Cognitive complexity should be reduced                 | Simplify nested logic, extract methods, avoid deep `if` trees.                |
| `S1192` | String literals should not be duplicated               | Replace with constants or enums.                                              |
| `S1854` | Unused assignments should be removed                   | Avoid dead variablesâ€”remove or refactor.                                      |
| `S109`  | Magic numbers should be replaced with constants        | Improves readability and maintainability.                                     |
| `S1188` | Catch blocks should not be empty                       | Always log or handle exceptions meaningfully.                                 |

## Build and Verification

- After adding or modifying code, verify the project continues to build successfully.
- If the project uses Maven, run `mvn clean install`.
- If the project uses Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows).
- Ensure all tests pass as part of the build.
